# GOMAXPROCS

GOMAXPROCS is an environment variable in Go that determines the maximum number of CPU cores that can be executing simultaneously. By default, Go sets this value to the number of available CPU cores, but it can be adjusted to limit the number of cores used by a Go program.

## Run

```bash
./build.sh
./run.sh
```

## Result
